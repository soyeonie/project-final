# Preproposal

## Project Idea:

# From the movie Clueless, Cher Horowitz's Virtual Closet
# To plan and style outfits with the intent to create an aesthetic and layerability

## Team:

Soyeon Kang (Section 006)
Lila Zelnick (Section 006)

## Questions:

# Will creating the styling algorithm be too complex?
# I was thinking about putting descriptors in each clothing item,
# But there is so much criteria I could use and combine, like
# color matching, occassion, and weather (format like PY game, website based)

# For scalability how many items are appropriate for each section,
# Tops, bottoms, dresses, shoes, outer wear, other items

# Reference file for our wardrobe but make the code applicable to insert your own
