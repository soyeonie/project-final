# PROPOSAL

# Project Title: 

Virtual Closet 

# Project Summary:
A website that’s your virtual closet, letting you digitally organize and plan outfits based on occasion, weather, and aesthetics. It’s like having a fashionista friend in your pocket, offering color matching features and the ability to browse through other people’s closets for inspiration.
# Project Overview: Software Features and Execution Plan
Our software will first initialize a user profile, prompting the creation of a unique username and password for their digital closet. Users can set their closet’s visibility to public or private, tailoring the experience to their comfort level. They can also specify their body type, or opt to use the default setting.
The core functionality lies in the wardrobe upload feature, where users can categorize their clothing items into predefined sections like pants, dresses, shirts, skirts, cardigans, jackets, etc. For those unique pieces that don’t fit into standard categories, users can define their own, specifying where the item would be worn on the body.
Once the wardrobe is uploaded, our software acts like a Python script with a series of ‘if-else’ conditions, prompting users to provide additional details about each item. This is done through an intuitive drag-and-drop interface, where users can specify attributes like material type and warmth level. The software also offers color and season recommendations, acting like a personal stylist.
Finally, akin to a ‘for’ loop iterating over an array, users can navigate through their digital closet using arrow keys or sprites, viewing different outfit combinations. They can even plan their outfits for the upcoming week using the closet calendar feature, making our software a comprehensive solution for wardrobe management and outfit planning.

# GOOD outcome:

The basic functionality of our software will be implemented no matter what. This includes user profile creation, wardrobe upload feature, categorization of clothing items, and the ability to navigate through the digital closet.


# BETTER outcome:

In addition to the basic features, we aim to categorize clothes by implementing the drag-and-drop interface for specifying attributes of clothing items, color and season recommendations, and the closet calendar feature for outfit planning.

# BEST outcome:

Our ultimate goal is to have a fully functional website with all the aforementioned features, along with additional enhancements like the ability to browse through other users’ closets, a feature to define custom categories for unique clothing items, and an improved user interface for a more engaging user experience. 

## Next steps: Skills, research topics, task delegation

Our next steps involve diving deeper into web development technologies. We’ll need to acquire skills in Python-based web frameworks like Django or Flask for backend development. For the frontend, we’ll need to learn and implement stronger Python and website/app oriented technologies.. We’ll also need to research on how to effectively implement the drag-and-drop interface and the color matching feature. We can divide the tasks based on individual strengths and interests. For instance, one can focus on backend development while the other can work on frontend. Regular meetings will be held to discuss progress, solve problems, and ensure that the project is on track.
