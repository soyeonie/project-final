Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?
We have coordinated through a google doc and organized resources to utilize to make this project happen. An example resource we are currently utilizing are tutorials related to Flask as we plan to create our website using Python. We have created a framework of the website and enabled basic user login. Furthermore, we have found sprites and images to use to make our website engaging to the user. 

TODO

#### What have you not done for your project yet?
We have taken on a lot, so there are quite a few things we still need to research such as creating a data base based on types of materials, colors, weather, etc., and other tools to make our website functional to our original purpose. While being user friendly is important, we are mainly focusing on accomplishing our goals to create a good outfit.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?
While practicing from tutorials online, I've encountered issues that the tutorial does not explain, so I am often researching the tutorial itself to understand my issue/mistake. One example is of the VS code folders and creating __ init__.py files within a main folder and then not being able to access some of the files from the main folder because of the placement of the init file. I've resolved this already, but I imagine that this will continue to occur throughout the project.
